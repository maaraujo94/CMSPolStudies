MASS FITS
- (MC) I suggest that you fix n, rather than alpha. I would take n = 1.15. Then, to establish a systematic uncertainty, we need to redo the full analysis varying the fixed inputs. We will then use n = 1.05 and 1.25 (or something broader, if the resulting systematics is negligible), always letting alpha free.
- (DATA) mass background alternative model linear function
- (DATA) I'm not sure how we could look into this mu issue. We could always fix it to the pdg value (or the mc value) in the data and see whether much changes. 
	Those are GREAT ideas for the systematics. Make a note of them both. We will follow them "next week".
- (DATA) So, I would suggest that you try both options and then we see. If you get much better DATA chi2/ndf values when leaving n and alpha free in the data (by constants), then maybe we should not exclude that option. At the very least, it would be useful as "systematics".


LIFETIME FITS
- The plot showing lambda vs pT shows a "relative drop" of 10/357 = 2.8%.
That means that a constant lambda vs. pT, lambda = 357 +- 1.4% micron, should give an equally good fit...
Just saying, in case you want to check it out as a "systematics" variation of the model.


BKG FRAC UNC
- We will surely need to assign an uncertainty to the J/psi lambda_theta vs. pT from all the "relevant" inputs. In this specific "source of systematics", we can "invent" a "reasonable variation" and see how the lambda_theta gets affected. The problem is only that someone will probably ask us how we can justify that the variation we used in the NP fraction (and in the Bg fraction) is "reasonable". If the effect on lambda_theta is anyway negligible, we do not care... It is easy to say that we used a "conservation variation". Otherwise, we need to be careful. We can come back to this once we have lambda_theta vs. pT, etc.
- we simply have to redo the whole analysis of the costheta distributions varying that fraction, f_Bg(pT), by 50% up and by 50% down. In any case, the pT dependence of f_Bg is not changed (or at least not change as much as the magnitude). So, the final physics result will remain precise.
