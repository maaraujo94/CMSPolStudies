# CMSPolStudies
framework for CMS S-wave quarkonium polarization studies

## Available directories:

- Store_data_codes: to run on LXPLUS, gives the data and MC (costheta_HX, pT) values of events that pass all cuts

- 1d_fit: stores events according to given binning, fits for lambda_theta in each pT bin (data/MC ratio of costheta_HX distribution fitted with angular distribution W(costheta_HX; lambda_theta))

- 2d_fit: fits for lambda_theta over all bins simultaneously, assuming some hypothesis of lambda_theta(pT)
